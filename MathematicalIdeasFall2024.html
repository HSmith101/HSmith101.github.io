<b>Welcome to Math 100: Mathematical Ideas! I am so excited to get to know you this semester and share the some of the beauty and joy I find in mathematics with you! 
We all bring different perspectives and backgrounds to the course, but the most important prerequisites are curiousity and an openness to new ways of thinking about 
what mathematics is.<br>
<br />
Below you will find A LOT of information on the who, what, when, where, how, and why of the course. 
I have built this syllabus so that you have easy access to the information you need to show up to each class prepared and confident.

<b><u>Homework</u></b>

<p>
There will be two types of homework assignments this semester: Written homework and WileyPlus (online) homework.
The written homework assignments will be posted in 
<b><a href="https://csusm.instructure.com/courses/34755/modules" target="_blank">
<font color="blue">the modules tab in Canvas</font></a></b>.  
They will be created by me and will feature exercises relevant to what we are learning and things I find interesting. 
The written homework will be due via 
<b><a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/834818" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Gradescope</font></a></b>. 
WileyPlus homework assignments are accessed via <b><a href="https://learn.wileyplus.com/courses/169359" target="_blank"><font color="blue">the WileyPlus website</font></a></b>
and feature questions from the text. 
To log into <a href="https://learn.wileyplus.com/courses/169359" target="_blank"><font color="blue">WileyPlus</font></a>, 
you will need <b><a href="WP_Section_Flyer_B25378.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="blue">this flyer</font></a></b>. 
WileyPlus is run in a Canvas shell, so it looks very similar to our CougarCourses page. 
Due dates for homework assignments are given in the 
<b><a href="MathematicalIdeasCourseScheduleFall2024.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Course Schedule</font></a></b>. 


<br />
<br />

We will usually grade a few written homework problems in-depth and grade the rest for completion. 
<b> Note that overall homework is 40% of your grade,</b> 
so spending time completing homework to perfection is very important. <br />

<p>It is natural and expected to struggle on homework. You are encouraged to work together and come to office hours for help with homework. <b>Homework is 
a place to learn how to do things!</b> You may use whatever resources you wish on the homework as long as you cite your sources and submit your own work.
<b>Copying and pasting the output of AI such as ChatGTP is academically dishonest.</b> 
You can and should use AI resources such as ChatGTP, but you should personalize your answers and ensure that they are your own.</p>

<!--<p>In general, late homework will be accepted at a deduction of 10% per day that the homework is late. 
Depending on the circumstances or timeline, I may choose not to accept late work.
If you are having a tough time or something comes up, then please let me know as soon as you can. 
I want to work with you to make sure that life events and unforseen circumstances do not impede your ability to succeed in this class! </p>-->


<li> All-University Writing Requirement: The requirement of 2500 words for courses of 3 or more units will be satisfied
via the assigned homework. </li>
<br>

<b><u>Support</u></b>

<p>Some other, more big-picture resources are the 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/sass/index.html" target="blank"><font color="blue">Student Academic Support Services (SASS)</font></a>, 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/asc/index.html" target="blank"><font color="blue">Academic Success Center</font></a>,  
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/students/index.html#acasupport" target="blank"><font color="blue">Academic Support</font></a>, and
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/lts/syllabuslanguage.html" target="blank"><font color="blue">Learning & Tutoring Services</font></a>. </p> 

<p>Finally, I have three+ hours a week that are specifically for helping y'all.
Please come to my office hours with any questions! If you think a question is dumb or you think
you "don't understand anything," then that is even more reason to come to my office hours. 
I am very used to struggling with math, and I want to help everyone learn in this course.
I can assure you that I have made math mistakes that are much more embarrassing than 
any mistake you will make in this course. </p>

<p>Class attendance is not mandatory this semester, though it is highly encouraged. 
I know flexibility is appreciated, so I will not grade participation directly. 
However, by missing class, you are missing important content, and you are responsible for catching yourself up.</p>

</p>

<p>
We will have three quizzes and a final. Ideally, these will be used to keep us on track and make sure we are engaging with the course. 
Quizzes will be in class and will last around 40 minutes. 
For the quizzes, the only additional resources you are allowed are a basic calculator, a notecard, and scratch paper.
Phones are not allowed on quizzes.

<p><b>Make-Up Policy:</b> In general, no make-ups for quizzes will be given. 
If you are going to miss a quiz and can show proof of some officially acceptable reason, e.g.: a verifiably documented medical excuse
or a conflicting official university sanctioned activity that cannot be rescheduled, then we can make arrangements.<br />
<br>
If you are sick or something comes up, then please let me know as far before the assignment or assessment is due as you can. 
We will do our best to get through this semester safely and healthily. 
On as case-by-case basis, I can try to make arrangements in a way that is as fair and equitable as possible.

<p>
Please avoid making travel arrangements that would not allow you to take the final at the scheduled
time. A final may be rescheduled if you have more than three finals in a single calendar day
or more than four final exams in a 24-hour period. <!-- All rescheduled final exams must be approved by the
<a href="https://dos.uconn.edu/" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Dean of Students Office</font></a> and they do not easily
allow rescheduling. -->
Please note that CSUSM does <bf>NOT</bf> consider
vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations, graduations, social events, misreading
the assigned final exam schedule, and oversleeping as viable excuses for missing a final exam.
If you think that your situation warrants permission to reschedule, please contact me as well as the DoS office as soon as possible.

</p>
This is an in-person class and has been designed to be taught in person. Not attending in person will affect your experience in this course.
However, to make it easier for you to engage in this course regardless of your situation, I will be asking for note takers and hopefully posting their notes.
Please let me know if you enjoy taking detailed notes and want to post them for everyone.
I'll be asking for volunteers to take notes. 
<a href="https://csusm.instructure.com/courses/34755/modules" target="blank"><font color="blue">
The notes will be posted in the "Modules" section in Canvas </font></a>.
<!--There will be days where we will do graded work in class. You must let me know well before these days if you are absolutely unable to attend. -->
<p>


<p>Late assignments will have points deducted based on how late the assignment is. 
I reserve the right to deduct points from late work or award no credit for late work as I see fit.
Unless otherwise noted or excepted, late work turned in after the last day of class will not be accepted.
Generally, I am happy to give extensions if you let me know well before an assignment is due. 
If you are having trouble staying on top of your assignments, please come talk to me. 
My goal is to help you learn.</p>

<p>
The last few years have been an incredibly tough time for everyone, myself included. 
I understand everyone is dealing with things differently and I will do my
best to be flexible and accomodating. I ask you to be open with me and to discuss issues with me when they come up. I will listen and do 
what I can to help you succeed in this course. Conversely, I am super excited to teach this course and I love this material, but this 
is my first semester at CSUSM. 
I ask that you be understanding of the mistakes I will certainly make, and I ask that you give me honest feedback about how I can
improve.

<p>
As individuals and as a class we will be respectful of everyone; language or behavior that discriminates against or excludes 
anyone will not be tolerated.
We will avoid stereotypes about who is "good" at math. Math is difficult, but also beautiful, and as a class we will work together to overcome 
difficulties and share the beauty. This is especially true with group work. You must treat your group members with respect and engage in positive 
and constructive conversations. If you are curious about what this environment looks like, I invite you to check out the

You are welcome to use AI in your studying. This is a powerful resource that will only continue to become a more prominent part of our lives.
However, merely copying the output of something like ChatGTP is academic dishonesty, and the output is often not terribly relevant to our course
and our assessments. </p>

<p>Students are responsible for honest completion and representation of their work. 
Unless otherwise noted, all completed assignments are to consist solely of your own individual work and ideas
without input from any external resources or persons. 
There will be zero tolerance for infractions. 
If you believe there has been an infraction by someone in the class, please bring it to the my attention. 
I reserve the right to discipline any student for academic dishonesty, 
in accordance with the general rules and regulations of the university. 
Disciplinary action may include the lowering of grades and/or the assignment of a failing grade for an exam, assignment, or the class as a whole.
It is recommended that students consult the

<p>I pledge to do my utmost as your instructor to support you and your success in this class. 
Regardless of your race, 
color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or 
expression, age, disabilities, citizenship, or national origin, I am happy that you're taking this course
and I am excited to help you learn math. I will do everything I can to make sure you feel welcome in
our classroom and address any aspects or elements of the course that may make you feel unwelcome. 
This runs the gamut from being willing to make accomodations for religious observances to making sure
our classroom is a supportive place. Please come to me with any concerns you have! I'm here to listen and 
to help give you the tools and conditions to be successful in this course.</p>

The University currently does not have a policy for children in classrooms. What follows is a reflection of my own commitments to students as parents:

You are welcome to feed your baby (breastfed and/or bottlefed) in my classroom;

If you need to pump breastmilk during class time, I would be happy to coordinate timing breaks around this; 

Unforeseen disruptions in childcare should not be a deterrent for attending class; it is perfectly acceptable to bring your child to class, as needed; 

As students and parents, you are held to the same standards as your peers (deadlines, etc.), 
but I am happy to discuss routines and practices that facilitate a healthy school-parenting balance.

As a three unit course, the award of credit in this course is based on learning activities 
outside of class meetings having been designed to require a minimum of six hours of effort each week working for most students. 
More prosaically, about three hours of work will be required for each 75 minutes we spend together in class. 
This work includes things like reading the text, working on homework problems, writing proofs, working in groups on projects, 
and studying for assessments.

<b> Cougar Care Network: </b>

The Dean of Students division provides support resources via the Cougar Care Network (CCN). 
CCN can be used by faculty, staff, and students. Per the CCN homepage, 
“Cougar Care Network(CCN) provides information, connection to resources, advocacy and support for students dealing with personal, 
academic, financial or other challenges which may adversely affect their academic success and/or collegiate experience.” 
As a student you may self-refer if you find that you need help with connecting with campus support resources. 
As your instructor, I may refer you to CCN if I see that you would benefit from campus assistance beyond what I can provide 
academically for the scope of this class. For more information visit
