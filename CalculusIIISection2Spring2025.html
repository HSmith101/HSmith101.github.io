<p><b>Official Course Description:</b> Differential and integral calculus of functions of several variables: three di-
mensional analytic geometry, vector calculus, partial derivatives, multiple integrals, line integrals,
applications, and historical perspectives. Includes a computer laboratory experience. Prerequisite:
MATH 162 with a grade of C (2.0) or better.</p>

<p>
<b>Goals:</b> The overarching goal for the semester is to gain a working knowledge of and fluency with multivariate differential and integral calculus.
The topics include three dimensional analytic geometry, vector calculus, partial deriva-
tives, multiple integrals, line integrals, and their applications.
We will work to understand not only computational aspects and definitions, but the parts, pieces, ideas, maps, and pictures that help us 
solve real world problems with calculus and build on these concepts in future courses. <br>
<br>
One practical goal that will underpin the course is 
deepening our familiarity with and maturity in mathematics. This includes developing the ability to communicate mathematics and reason mathematically. 
We will spend our time reading, understanding, responding to, and writing mathematics. 
A goal of this course is 
to open and develop this kind of mathematical dialogue with your professor and peers. To this end, we will create a welcoming and supportive classroom
community that gives us space to make mistakes and learn. <br>

<li> Please consider how what we are doing in this course relates to the goals above and how the goals relate to the 
<a href="#outcomes"target="_blank"><font color="blue">outcomes</font></a> listed below.
I have thought extensively about how each level of this schaffolding supports the next, but I would love to hear about ways 
the course and our ability to meet our goals can be improved.

What are grades? What purpose do they serve? What do they mean? <a href="https://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/" target="_blank"><font color="blue">
This blog post</font></a> outlines some problems with grades. 

</p>

<p>
The following is the grading scheme that I would like to implement for the course. 
I feel it strikes a balance between a variety of different manners of doing and presenting mathematics.
Please let me know if you would like to see any changes. 
I would like everyone to understand how grades are calculated. <br />

<li>WebAssign: &nbsp; 20%
<li>Collected Worksheets and Written Homework: &nbsp; 20%
<li>Exam 1: &nbsp; 20%*
<li>Exam 2: &nbsp; 20%*
<li>Exam 3: &nbsp; 20%*
<li>Final Exam:  &nbsp; 20%*

<br/>
<br/>
*The lowest exam grade will be dropped, while each of your other exams will be 20% of your final grade.

<p><b>WebAssign Homework:</b> WebAssign homework assignments will be assigned via WebAssign and
due by the posted date and time. See the <a href="CalculusIIISection1CourseScheduleSpring2025.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Course Schedule</font><a>. 
The WebAssign software automatically evaluates each response
and computes a score for this assignment. Please let me know if you discover an error in the grading.
Screenshots are very helpful in this situation. <!--The two lowest scoring WebAssign homework assign-
ments will be dropped from the computation of your grade.
WebAssign: WebAssign is an online homework system. It is not a tutorial system. You will
learn the material by listening to lectures, by participating in active learning and by reading the
textbook.-->
Further, though WebAssign only evaluates the final answer, it is a good idea to write your reasoning down and keep these notes as a reference.
Written homework/worksheets and exams will be graded on the entire writeup of the solution, not just the final answer.
<!--hen working with WebAssign, have pen and paper ready to work out the answer. WebAssign only
accepts the nal answer, and not the entire solution. It is a good idea to maintain a notebook for
recording your solutions and thought process before entering the worked out answer in WebAssign.
The notebook will serve as a valuable reference.
WebAssign allows a small number of attempts to get your answer right. After this, a new alternate
question is generated. The number of attempts is usually 3 unless the question is multiple choice.
The drawback of WebAssign is that it is syntax dependent. You will have to learn the syntax and
input mechanism forWebAssign. WebAssign does not evaluate the complete solution and reasoning
that went into arriving at an answer. In order to evaluate this, written homework is necessary.-->
For more details on WebAssign see 
<a href="https://www.webassign.net/manual/student_guide/introduction.htm" target="_blank">
<font color="blue">https://www.webassign.net/manual/student_guide/introduction.htm</font><a>.
<br>
<br>

<p> In addition to WebAssign, we will have worksheets and written homework. 
The latter portion of most class meetings will be devoted to working on these assignments in groups. 
Written homeworks and worksheets will be posted on Canvas. 
These are due on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/958026" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Gradescope</font></a>. 
Due dates are posted in the <a href="CalculusIIISection1CourseScheduleSpring2025.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Course Schedule</font><a>.
Solutions must be clear, complete, and fully justified to receive full credit. 
Solutions, including equations, should be written in complete sentences. I encourage you to read your solutions aloud.
Your peers should be able to read your solutions and clearly understand your reasoning.
I encourage you to model your solutions on what is presented in the lecture and in the textbook.
Please work with other students and use all resources available to solve the problems. 
However, your final writeup should be your own work, and all external resources used should be cited.
<br>
<br>
It is natural and expected to struggle on homework. You are encouraged to work together and come to office hours for help with homework. 
<b>Homework is a place to learn how to do things!</b> You may use whatever resources you wish on the homework as long as you cite your sources and submit your own work. 
<b>Copying and pasting the output of generative AI such as ChatGTP is academically dishonest. </b> 
You can and should use generative AI resources such as ChatGTP, but you should interpret and personalize your answers, ensuring that they are your own.
<br>
<br>

<b>Support</b>

<p>Some big-picture resources are the 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/sass/index.html" target="blank"><font color="blue">Student Academic Support Services (SASS)</font></a>, 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/asc/index.html" target="blank"><font color="blue">Academic Success Center</font></a>, and the 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/students/index.html#acasupport" target="blank"><font color="blue">academic support</font></a>. </p> 

<p>Finally, I have three+ hours a week that are specifically for helping y'all!
Please come to my office hours with any questions! If you think a question is dumb or you think
you "don't understand anything," then that is even more reason to come to my office hours. 
I am very used to struggling with math and I want to help everyone learn in this course.
I can assure you that I have made math mistakes that are much more embarrassing than 
any mistake you will make in this course. </p>

<p>Class attendance is not mandatory this semester, though it is highly encouraged. 
In order to promote flexibility, I will not grade participation directly. 
However, we will have in-class assessments.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

</p>

<p>
We will have three midterm exams and a final exam. 


<p> In-class exams are closed book and notes. They will last 60 minutes. Exam problems will be very similar to homework problems from WebAssign, written homework,
worksheets, and lecture. 


<p><b>Make-Up Policy:</b> In general, no make-ups for exams will be given. 
If you are going to miss an exam and can show proof of some officially acceptable reason, e.g.: a verifiably documented medical excuse
or a conflicting official university sanctioned activity that cannot be rescheduled, then we can make arrangements.<br />
If you are sick or something comes up, then please let me know as far before the exam or assignment as you can. 
We will do our best to get through this semester safely and healthily. 
On as case-by-case basis, I can try to make arrangements in a way that is as fair and equitable as possible.

<p>
Please avoid making travel arrangements that would not allow you to take the final at the scheduled
time. A final may be rescheduled if you have more than three finals in a single calendar day
or more than four final exams in a 24-hour period. <!-- All rescheduled final exams must be approved by the
<a href="https://dos.uconn.edu/" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Dean of Students Office</font></a> and they do not easily
allow rescheduling. -->
Please note that CSUSM does <bf>NOT</bf> consider
vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations, graduations, social events, misreading
the assigned final exam schedule, and oversleeping as viable excuses for missing a final exam.
If you think that your situation warrants permission to reschedule, please contact me as well as the DoS office as soon as possible.

Students will develop a computational and conceptual fluency in the following material:
<li> Vectors and three-dimensional coordinate systems including the dot product, cross product, and equations of lines and planes.
<li> Vector-valued functions and their derivatives and integrals including an understanding of the connections to position, velocity, and acceleration.
<li> Partial derivatives and their applications including tangent planes, linear approximations, directional derivates, the gradient, and specific applications to max/min problems.
<li> Multiple integrals including double integrals in polar coordinates, triple integrals in cylindrical and spherical coordinates, and changing variables in multiple integrals.
<li> Vector Calculus including the fundamental theorem for line integrals, Green's theorem, and basic perspectives on Stokes' theorem.
Underpinning this fluency is developing and deepening connections between these concepts and other mathematical concepts that students have encountered both formally and informally.

This is an in-person class and has been designed to be taught in person. 
Not attending in person will affect your experience in this course.
However, to make it easier for you to engage in this course regardless of your situation, 
I will be asking for note takers and hopefully posting their notes.
Please let me know if you enjoy taking detailed notes and want to post them for everyone.
<!--Update: Two very kind students have volunteered to take notes. 
<a href="https://csusm.instructure.com/courses/5143/modules" target="blank"><font color="blue">
The notes are now posted in the "Modules" section in Canvas. </font></a>. -->
There will be days where we will do graded work in class. 
You must let me know well before these days if you are absolutely unable to attend. 
<p>


<p>Late assignments will have points deducted based on how late the assignment is. 
I reserve the right to deduct points from late work or award no credit for late work as I see fit.
Unless otherwise noted or excepted, late work turned in after the last day of class will not be accepted.
Generally, I am happy to give extensions if you let me know well before an assignment is due. 
If you are having trouble staying on top of your assignments, please come talk to me. 
My goal is to help you learn.</p>

<p>
I understand everyone is dealing with different things in their lives, 
and I will do my best to be flexible and accomodating.
I ask you to be open with me and to discuss issues with me when they come up. 
I will listen and do what I can to help you succeed in this course. 
Conversely, I ask that you be understanding of the mistakes I will certainly make, 
and I ask that you give me honest feedback about how I can improve.

<p>
As individuals and as a class we will be respectful of everyone; 
language or behavior that discriminates against or excludes anyone will not be tolerated.
We will avoid stereotypes about who is "good" at math. 
Math is difficult, but also beautiful, 
and as a class we will work together to overcome difficulties and share the beauty. 
This is especially true with group work. 
You must treat your group members with respect and engage in positive and constructive conversations.

Students will be expected to adhere to the guideline of academic honesty and integrity, as outlined in the 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/dos/studres/standards_student_conduct.html" target="blank">
<font color="blue">CSUSM Standards for Student Conduct</font></a>.
 
All assignments must be original work, clear and error-free. 
All ideas/material that are borrowed from other sources must have appropriate references to the original sources. 
Any quoted material should give credit to the source and be punctuated accordingly.  </p>

<p>Students are responsible for honest completion and representation of their work. 
Unless otherwise noted, all completed assignments are to consist solely of your own individual work and ideas
without input from any external resources or persons. 
There will be zero tolerance for infractions. 
If you believe there has been an infraction by someone in the class, please bring it to the my attention. 
I reserve the right to discipline any student for academic dishonesty, 
in accordance with the general rules and regulations of the university. 
Disciplinary action may include the lowering of grades and/or the assignment of a failing grade for an exam, assignment, or the class as a whole.
It is recommended that students consult the 
<a href="https://csusm.policystat.com/policy/7984230/latest/" target="blank"><font color="blue">CSUSM Academic Honesty Policy</font></a>.</p>
<!-- I expect you to be familiar with and abide by
<a href="https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a/" target="_blank">
<font color="blue">UConn's academic integrity policy</font></a> at all times. There should be no
help given or received on exams or quizzes, not from other people, not from tutors, not from online sites.

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, providing or receiving assistance in a manner
not authorized by the instructor in the creation of work to be submitted for academic evaluation
(e.g. papers, projects, examinations and assessments - whether online or in class); presenting,
as one's own, the ideas, words or calculations of another for academic evaluation; doing
unauthorized academic work for which another person will receive credit or be evaluated;
using unauthorized aids in preparing work for evaluation (e.g. unauthorized formula sheets,
unauthorized calculators, unauthorized programs or formulas loaded into your calculator, etc.);
and presenting the same or substantially the same papers or projects in two or more courses without
the explicit permission of the instructors involved.

A student who knowingly assists another student in committing an act of academic misconduct
shall be equally accountable for the violation, and shall be subject to the sanctions and other
remedies as described in <a href="https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a/" target="_blank">

Regardless of your race, 
color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or

and I am excited to help you learn math. I will do everything I can to make sure you feel welcome in
our classroom and address any aspects or elements of the course that may make you feel unwelcome. 
This runs the gamut from being willing to make accomodations for religious observances to making sure
our classroom is a supportive place. Please come to me with any concerns you have! I'm here to listen and

</p>

The University currently does not have a policy for children in classrooms. What follows is a reflection of my own commitments to students as parents:

You are welcome to feed your baby (breastfed and/or bottlefed) in my classroom;

If you need to pump breastmilk during class time, I would be happy to coordinate timing breaks around this; 

Unforeseen disruptions in childcare should not be a deterrent for attending class; it is perfectly acceptable to bring your child to class, as needed; 

As students and parents, you are held to the same standards as your peers (deadlines, etc.), 
but I am happy to discuss routines and practices that facilitate a healthy school-parenting balance.

As a four unit course, the award of credit in this course is based on learning activities 
outside of class meetings having been designed to require a minimum of eight hours of effort each week working for most students. 
More prosaically, about two hours of work will be required for each 50 minutes we spend together in class. 
This work includes things like reading the text, working on homework problems, working in groups on worksheets, 
and studying for assessments.

<b> Cougar Care Network: </b>

The Dean of Students division provides support resources via the Cougar Care Network (CCN). 
CCN can be used by faculty, staff, and students. Per the CCN homepage, 
“Cougar Care Network(CCN) provides information, connection to resources, advocacy and support for students dealing with personal, 
academic, financial or other challenges which may adversely affect their academic success and/or collegiate experience.” 
As a student you may self-refer if you find that you need help with connecting with campus support resources. 
As your instructor, I may refer you to CCN if I see that you would benefit from campus assistance beyond what I can provide 
academically for the scope of this class. For more information visit
