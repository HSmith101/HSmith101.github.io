The primary goal for the semester is to learn, understand, and be able to
work with the vocabulary, algorithmic manipulations, main ideas, and concepts of linear algebra, specifically as outlined in Course Content. 
A very important secondary goal is to develop the ability to communicate mathematics and reason mathematically. 
This includes reading, understanding, and responding to mathematical arguments. 
You are probably familiar with having this mathematical dialogue with an instructor, but a goal of this course is 
to open and develop this kind of dialogue with your peers.

<!-- including systems of linear equations, matrices,
vector spaces (concrete and abstract) and their bases, linear transformations and change of
bases matrices, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, orthogonalization, various matrix factorizations, and the applications
of these ideas. This does not only mean that you should be able to work through a bunch of questions
similar to ones seen in the homework, but that you should have the ability to articulate the ideas
presented in the course in a clear and coherent manner as well. You should be able to apply the theory
in new and imaginative ways. This course will have concrete and abstract components. Being able to explain
why something is true will constitute a significant part of the course.-->

<a href="https://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/" target="_blank"><font color="blue">
This blog post</font></a> outlines some problems with grades. </br>

Below is how I suggest we calculate grades in this course. 
Please let me know if you have any suggestions or find this scheme over/under-emphasizes anything.

</p>

<p>
<li>Homework: &nbsp; 25%
<li>Quizzes:&nbsp;30%
<li>Final Exam:  &nbsp; 20%
<li>Primary Source Project: &nbsp; 15%
<li>Honors Project: &nbsp; 10%

The homework assignments for the semester in Pearson's MyLab which you will access through HuskyCT. Due dates for homework assignments are given in the 
<b><a href="LinearAlgebraSpring2022Schedule.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Course Schedule</font></a>.</b> 
As explained there, homework assignments must be submitted by 11:59 pm the day they are due. 

<!--<p><b>Piazza Discussion Board:</b> The discussion board will be on Piazza, accessed through HuskyCT. Piazza is a place you can go to ask/answer questions and talk with your peers 
about what we are working on. I will also post further explanations and homework hints on Piazza. I would like people to go onto Piazza sometime after each class and ask a question 
about something they found confusing or try to answer/comment on someone else's question. Though this won't be a formal part of your grade, I think routinely discussing things on Piazza 
will make this class more meaninful and help you learn the material better and more quickly. You can sign up via HuskyCT (I think) or via the
<b><a href="https://piazza.com/uconn/fall2020/1208uconnmath2210qsec0126963" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Piazza link</font></a></b>.
</p>-->

<p>It is natural and expected to struggle on homework. You are encouraged to work together and come to office hours for help with homework. 
<br />
<b>Homework is a place to learn how to do things!</b></p>

<p>You can also use the <a href="https://qcenter.uconn.edu" target="blank"><font color="00 00 FF">Q-Center</font></a> as a place to get help. 
It is an awesome resource; the 
tutors there are paid to help you! You will want to check what times someone who is comfortable helping with linear algebra is available. </p>

<p>Two other, more big-picture resources are the 
<a href="https://achieve.uconn.edu/" target="blank"><font color="blue">Academic Achievement Center</font></a> and the 
<a href="https://onlinestudent.uconn.edu/keeplearning/" target="blank"><font color="blue">Keep Learning Site</font></a>. </p> 

<p>Finally, I have three hours a week that are specifically for helping y'all. Please come to my office hours with any questions! 
If you think a question is dumb or you think
you "don't understand anything," then that is even more reason to come to my office hours. 
I am very used to struggling with math and I want to help everyone learn in this course.
<!-- I can assure you that I have made math mistakes that are much more embarrassing than 
any mistake you will make in this course. --></p>

<p>Class attendance is not mandatory this semester, though it is highly encouraged. I know things are difficult for everyone right now and 
I know flexibility is appreciated, so I will not grade participation directly.

In this class we will have four quizzes and a final.
We have yet to be assigned a final exam time, but the plan is to use the first hour of our assigned final exam time. 
<br />
<!-- The final will be Monday, Dec. 13 at 10:30 am in MONT 419, our usual classroom. The plan is for the exam to only last one hour of our two hour slot. -->


<p>The quizzes will last 20 minutes and be at the beginning of class sporadically throughout the semester. 
After finishing the quiz you will use camscanner to upload the quiz to HuskyCT.
You will grade your own quiz after class based on a rubric that I will create. 
(I reserve the right to overturn your grading decisions.)
After grading your quiz you may write corrections/reflections in order to receive up to one third credit back on the problems you missed. 
(The above scheme was changed from last semester so that I have room to write less difficult quizzes.)
You will have one chance to make corrections.  
<br />
<br />
<b>Grading, Corrections, and Reflection Expectations: </b> Your graded quiz with corrections and reflection is due within one week of the time of the quiz. 
For example, Quiz 1 is on Monday the 7th and your graded quiz with your reflection and corrections will be due at the start of class on Monday the 14th.
Corrections that are not fully correct and explained will receive no points back. 
The reflection should assess how you think you are doing in the class and whether the ways in which you are studying are effective. 
If you are not satisfied with how you're doing, your reflection should explain how you will change your approach to improve your performance. <br />
<a href="SampleQuiz.pdf" target="blank"><font color="blue">
Here is a sample of how your finished graded and corrected quiz with reflections might look.</font></a>


<p><b>Make-Up Policy:</b> In general, no make-ups for quizzes or the final exam will be given. If you are going to miss the exam
or a quiz and can show proof of some officially acceptable reason, e.g.: a verifiably documented medical excuse
or a conflicting official university sanctioned activity that cannot be rescheduled, then we can make arrangements.

<!-- <p>
Please avoid making travel arrangements that would not allow you to take the final at the scheduled
time. All rescheduled final exams must be approved by the
<a href="https://dos.uconn.edu/" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Dean of Students Office</font></a> and they do not easily
allow rescheduling. Please note that they do <bf>NOT</bf> consider
vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations, graduations, social events, misreading
the assigned final exam schedule, and oversleeping as viable excuses for missing a final exam either.
If you think that your situation warrants permission to reschedule, please contact the Dean of Students Office to meet
with a staff member as soon as possible. They  have set November 16, 2018 as the last date they will consider rescheduling finals for all issue known before Nov. 16.

This is an incredibly tough time for everyone, myself included. I understand everyone is dealing with things differently and I will do my
best to be flexible and accomodating. I ask you to be open with me and to discuss issues with me when they come up. I will listen and do 
what I can to help you succeed in this course. Conversely, I am super excited to teach this course and I love this material. 
However, this is my first semester teaching in person at UConn.
I ask that you be understanding of the mistakes I will certainly make, and I ask that you give me honest feedback about how I can
improve.

<p>
As individuals and as a class we will be respectful of everyone; language or behavior that discriminates against anyone will not be tolerated.
We will avoid stereotypes about who is "good" at math. Math is difficult, but also beautiful, and as a class we will work together to overcome 
difficulties and share the beauty. 
This is especially true with group work. 
You must treat your group members with respect and engage in positive and constructive
conversations.

<p>I pledge to do my utmost as your instructor to support you and your success in this class. 
Regardless of your race, 
color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or 
expression, age, disabilities, citizenship, or national origin, I am happy that you're taking this course
and I am excited to help you learn math. I will do everything I can to make sure you feel welcome in
our virtual classroom and address any aspects or elements of the course that may make you feel unwelcome. 
This runs the gamut from being willing to make accomodations for religious observances to making sure
our classroom is a supportive place. Please come to me with any concerns you have! I'm here to listen and 
to help give you the tools and conditions to be successful in this course.</p>

<!--<p>
Some students may wish to take part in religious observances during this academic
term. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course,
please let me know before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.

with your participation in this course. I should know of these conflicts within the first two
weeks of the course. Alternate arrangements for away game conflicts with quizzes/the final might be possible.
