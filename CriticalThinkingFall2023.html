<b>Welcome to Math 110: Critical Thinking! I am so excited to get to know you this semester and share the some of the beauty and joy I find in mathematics with you! 
We all bring different perspectives and backgrounds to the course, but the most important prerequisites are curiousity and an openness to new ways of thinking about 
what mathematics is.<br>

Below you will find A LOT of information on the who, what, when, where, how, and why of the course. 
I have built this syllabus so that you have easy access to the information you need to show up to each class prepared and confident. 
However, I aim to be one of your most useful resources. 
Please reach out to me if you have any questions or need any help.  </b>

</p>


<p style="text-align:left"><b>Course Description from Catalog: </b> 
Critical thinking in decision-making. Formal and informal fallacies of language and thought; 
the often unreliable guide of common-sense reasoning; analysis and criticism of ideas; 
distinction between fact and judgment, belief and knowledge; inductive and deductive arguments; and effective techniques of decision-making.  
Students will learn critical thinking skills to apply to common issues of everyday life.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left">
<b>Critical Thinking Learning Outcomes:</b> 
<br />
• A3.1: Distinguish matters of fact from issues of judgment or opinion and derive factual or 
judgmental inferences from unambiguous statements of knowledge or belief. <br />
• A3.2: Judge the reliability and credibility of sources. <br />
• A3.3: Effectively argue a point of view by clarifying the issues, focusing on the pertinent issues, and staying relevant to the topic. <br />
• A3.4: Understand the nature of inductive and deductive reasoning, identify formal and informal fallacies of reasoning, 
and employ various methods for testing the strength, soundness, and validity of different argument forms. <br />
• A3.5: Understand the basic concepts of meaning (sense, reference, connotation, etc.) and identify different methods of word definition. <br />
• A3.6: Understand logic and its relationship to language by identifying the basic components of reasoning, including the propositional content of statements, the functions of premises and conclusions in the makeup of arguments, the linkage between evidence and inference, and the rules of inference and logical equivalence.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left"><b>General Education Critical Thinking Goals:</b>
Critical thinking courses should help students learn logic and reasoning, understand sound argument, 
and appreciate the value of applying these skills. 
The course should teach students how language is related to logic, how to analyze the validity of a statement or argument, 
and how valid arguments can be constructed. Students should develop the critical habits of being open-minded and impartial, 
suspending judgment or taking a stance when warranted, questioning their own views, and using their critical thinking skills. 
Students should recognize that real world problems are complex and not solved with one simple answer. 
As critical thinkers, they should be able to transfer what they learn to new situations, whether in other courses or in their everyday lives.
<br />

<p style="text-align:left"><b>My Goals: </b> I think CSUSM's goals above are great. In addition to achieving these goals, I want to help you gain a deeper 
perspective into what mathematics is and help you build a foundation of mathematical logic and thinking that will serve you
well in the future. 
</p>


<li> Please consider how what we are doing in this course relates to the outcomes above.
I have worked to make sure every aspect of this course works to support these outcomes and goals,
but I would love to hear about ways the course and our ability to meet our goals can be improved.

<b><u>Homework</u></b>

<p>
There will be six homework assignments this semester. The 
homework assignments will be posted in 
<b><a href="https://csusm.instructure.com/courses/26002/modules" target="_blank">
<font color="blue">the modules tab in Canvas</font></a></b>.  
They will be created by me and will feature exercises relevant to what we are learning and things I find interesting. 
Due dates for homework assignments are given in the 
<b><a href="CriticalThinkingCourseScheduleFall2023.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Course Schedule</font></a></b>. 
Except for Homework 0, the homework is due on Sundays at 11:59 pm via 
<b><a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/574765" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Gradescope</font></a></b>. 

<br />
<br />

I will usually grade two to three homework problems in-depth and grade the rest for completion. 
<b> Note that homework is 50% of your grade,</b> 
so spending time completing homework to perfection is
very important. <br />
<!-- <b>Physical homework without a staple and/or with "frills" will not be accepted.</b> -->

<p>It is natural and expected to struggle on homework. You are encouraged to work together and come to office hours for help with homework. <b>Homework is 
a place to learn how to do things!</b> You may use whatever resources you wish on the homework as long as you cite your sources and submit your own work.</p>

<b><u>Essays</u></b>

<p>There will be three essays this semester. The goal of these essays is to develop a thesis that addresses the prompt 
and provide evidence to support your thesis. This is a math course, so clarity is more important than sophisticated prose.
These essays will be two to three or more pages. You may choose whatever font and formatting you prefer so long as it is easy for me to read
(12pt or larger) and is not obviously intended to inflate the number of pages. 
<a href="https://www.vuu.edu/Content/Uploads/vuu.edu/files/University%20College/Writing%20Assignment%20Rubric%208%2019%2018.pdf" target="blank">
<font color="blue">Here is a rubric </font></a> that I found online that reflects what I am looking for in essays and 
how I will grade essays. We will spend a week of class working on your first essay, so you will have plenty of time to work with
me and your peers on developing your writing. Lastly, <a href="#writing">the Writing Center</a> is an awesome resource, and
I encourage you to use it.</p>

<li> All-University Writing Requirement: The requirement of 2500 words for courses of 3 or more units will be satisfied
via the assigned essays. </li>
<br>

<b><u>Support</u></b>

<p>Some other, more big-picture resources are the 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/sass/index.html" target="blank"><font color="blue">Student Academic Support Services (SASS)</font></a>, 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/asc/index.html" target="blank"><font color="blue">Academic Success Center</font></a>, and the 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/students/index.html#acasupport" target="blank"><font color="blue">academic support</font></a>. </p> 

<p>Finally, I have three+ hours a week that are specifically for helping y'all.
Please come to my office hours with any questions! If you think a question is dumb or you think
you "don't understand anything," then that is even more reason to come to my office hours. 
I am very used to struggling with math, and I want to help everyone learn in this course.
I can assure you that I have made math mistakes that are much more embarrassing than 
any mistake you will make in this course. </p>

<p>Class attendance is not mandatory this semester, though it is highly encouraged. 
I know flexibility is appreciated, so I will not grade participation directly. 
However, by missing class, you are missing important content, and you are responsible for catching yourself up.</p>

</p>

<p>
We will not have any in-class exams, midterms, or quizzes. However, aside from the first two homeworks, each homework assignment is 10% of your grade. 
Thus, each homework is like a take-home quiz. With this in mind. You are expected to put concerted and consistent effort into each homework assignment.

<br>
<br>

For an example of how important each homework assignment is, imagine a student who doesn't turn in the last two homeworks.
Suppose this student gets a 100% on every other assignment. This students final grade in the class would be 80%, around a B-.
Thus, doing well on each homework assignment is key to your success in this course.
<!--

<p> These are in-class assessments and are closed book and notes. The midterm will likely last for a
full class period and the quiz will last 30 minutes or so.

<!--<p> After hearing everyones' ideas on grading, <strike>I've decided to change the quiz format to better reflect the things you want in grading.
We will still have three quizzes, but they will be a bit longer (20-25 min.). 
You'll upload a camscanner picture of your quiz to HuskyCT once you finish, but you'll take your quiz home with you to grade yourself.
I'll give you a rough rubric/idea of how I would grade it, but you will grade and correct your quiz yourself. 
You will then turn-in your graded quiz with corrections and a reflection on how you're doing in the class one week after the original date of the quiz. 
We will talk about the expectations for the corrections and the reflection in more detail once we get closer to the date of the first quiz. </strike>

<p>The take-home final is open book and notes, but closed everything else.</b> 
Using any resource outside of your book and your notes constitutes 
academic dishonesty and will be dealt with accordingly. 

<p><b>Make-Up Policy:</b> In general, no make-ups for a quiz or a midterm will be given. 
If you are going to miss one of these assignments and can show proof of some officially acceptable reason, e.g.: a verifiably documented medical excuse
or a conflicting official university sanctioned activity that cannot be rescheduled, then we can make arrangements.<br />
If you are sick or something comes up, then please let me know as far before the assessment is due as you can. 
We will do our best to get through this semester safely and healthily. 
On as case-by-case basis, I can try to make arrangements in a way that is as fair and equitable as possible.

<!-- <p>
Please avoid making travel arrangements that would not allow you to take the final at the scheduled

or more than four final exams in a 24-hour period. <!-- All rescheduled final exams must be approved by the

<!-- Please note that CSUSM does <bf>NOT</bf> consider
vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations, graduations, social events, misreading
the assigned final exam schedule, and oversleeping as viable excuses for missing a final exam.

This is an in-person class and has been designed to be taught in person. Not attending in person will affect your experience in this course.
However, to make it easier for you to engage in this course regardless of your situation, I will be asking for note takers and hopefully posting their notes.
Please let me know if you enjoy taking detailed notes and want to post them for everyone.
Update: Two very kind students have volunteered to take notes. 
<a href="https://csusm.instructure.com/courses/3459/modules" target="blank"><font color="blue">
The notes will be posted in the "Modules" section in Canvas </font></a>.
<!--There will be days where we will do graded work in class. You must let me know well before these days if you are absolutely unable to attend. -->
<p>


<p>Late assignments will have points deducted based on how late the assignment is. 
I reserve the right to deduct points from late work or award no credit for late work as I see fit.
Unless otherwise noted or excepted, late work turned in after the last day of class will not be accepted.
Generally, I am happy to give extensions if you let me know well before an assignment is due. 
If you are having trouble staying on top of your assignments, please come talk to me. 
My goal is to help you learn.</p>

<p>
The last few years have been an incredibly tough time for everyone, myself included. 
I understand everyone is dealing with things differently and I will do my
best to be flexible and accomodating. I ask you to be open with me and to discuss issues with me when they come up. I will listen and do 
what I can to help you succeed in this course. Conversely, I am super excited to teach this course and I love this material, but this 
is my first semester at CSUSM. 
I ask that you be understanding of the mistakes I will certainly make, and I ask that you give me honest feedback about how I can
improve.

<p>
As individuals and as a class we will be respectful of everyone; language or behavior that discriminates against or excludes 
anyone will not be tolerated.
We will avoid stereotypes about who is "good" at math. Math is difficult, but also beautiful, and as a class we will work together to overcome 
difficulties and share the beauty. This is especially true with group work. You must treat your group members with respect and engage in positive 
and constructive conversations. If you are curious about what this environment looks like, I invite you to check out the

<p>

Students will be expected to adhere to the guideline of academic honesty and integrity, as outlined in the 
<a href="https://www.csusm.edu/dos/studres/standards_student_conduct.html" target="blank">
<font color="blue">CSUSM Standards for Student Conduct</font></a>.
 
All assignments must be original work, clear and error-free. 
All ideas/material that are borrowed from other sources must have appropriate references to the original sources. 
Any quoted material should give credit to the source and be punctuated accordingly. 
You are welcome to use AI in your studying. This is a powerful resource that will only continue to become a more prominent part of our lives.
However, merely copying the output of something like ChatGTP is academic dishonesty, and the output is often not terribly relevant to our course
and our assessments. </p>

<p>Students are responsible for honest completion and representation of their work. 
Unless otherwise noted, all completed assignments are to consist solely of your own individual work and ideas
without input from any external resources or persons. 
There will be zero tolerance for infractions. 
If you believe there has been an infraction by someone in the class, please bring it to the my attention. 
I reserve the right to discipline any student for academic dishonesty, 
in accordance with the general rules and regulations of the university. 
Disciplinary action may include the lowering of grades and/or the assignment of a failing grade for an exam, assignment, or the class as a whole.
It is recommended that students consult the 
<a href="https://csusm.policystat.com/policy/7984230/latest/" target="blank"><font color="blue">CSUSM Academic Honesty Policy</font></a>.</p>
<!-- I expect you to be familiar with and abide by
<a href="https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a/" target="_blank">
<font color="blue">UConn's academic integrity policy</font></a> at all times. There should be no
help given or received on exams or quizzes, not from other people, not from tutors, not from online sites.

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, providing or receiving assistance in a manner
not authorized by the instructor in the creation of work to be submitted for academic evaluation
(e.g. papers, projects, examinations and assessments - whether online or in class); presenting,
as one's own, the ideas, words or calculations of another for academic evaluation; doing
unauthorized academic work for which another person will receive credit or be evaluated;
using unauthorized aids in preparing work for evaluation (e.g. unauthorized formula sheets,
unauthorized calculators, unauthorized programs or formulas loaded into your calculator, etc.);
and presenting the same or substantially the same papers or projects in two or more courses without
the explicit permission of the instructors involved.

A student who knowingly assists another student in committing an act of academic misconduct
shall be equally accountable for the violation, and shall be subject to the sanctions and other
remedies as described in <a href="https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code-appendix-a/" target="_blank">
<font color="blue">Appendix A</font></a> of the <a href="https://community.uconn.edu/the-student-code/" target="_blank">

Sanctions shall include, but are not limited to, a letter sent to the Office of Community
Standards of the University; a grade of 0 on the assignment, quiz or exam; a grade of F for
the course. -->

Regardless of your race, 
color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or

and I am excited to help you learn math. I will do everything I can to make sure you feel welcome in
our classroom and address any aspects or elements of the course that may make you feel unwelcome. 
This runs the gamut from being willing to make accomodations for religious observances to making sure
our classroom is a supportive place. Please come to me with any concerns you have! I'm here to listen and

The University currently does not have a policy for children in classrooms. What follows is a reflection of my own commitments to students as parents:

You are welcome to feed your baby (breastfed and/or bottlefed) in my classroom;

If you need to pump breastmilk during class time, I would be happy to coordinate timing breaks around this; 

Unforeseen disruptions in childcare should not be a deterrent for attending class; it is perfectly acceptable to bring your child to class, as needed; 

As students and parents, you are held to the same standards as your peers (deadlines, etc.), 
but I am happy to discuss routines and practices that facilitate a healthy school-parenting balance.

As a three unit course, the award of credit in this course is based on learning activities 
outside of class meetings having been designed to require a minimum of six hours of effort each week working for most students. 
More prosaically, about three hours of work will be required for each 75 minutes we spend together in class. 
This work includes things like reading the text, working on homework problems, writing proofs, working in groups on projects, 
and studying for assessments.

<b> Cougar Care Network: </b>

The Dean of Students division provides support resources via the Cougar Care Network (CCN). 
CCN can be used by faculty, staff, and students. Per the CCN homepage, 
“Cougar Care Network(CCN) provides information, connection to resources, advocacy and support for students dealing with personal, 
academic, financial or other challenges which may adversely affect their academic success and/or collegiate experience.” 
As a student you may self-refer if you find that you need help with connecting with campus support resources. 
As your instructor, I may refer you to CCN if I see that you would benefit from campus assistance beyond what I can provide 
academically for the scope of this class. For more information visit
