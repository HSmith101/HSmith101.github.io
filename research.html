<big><b>Generally, I am interested in algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.</b>
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~kala/nts/smith.mp4">Here</a> is a talk I gave at the Charles University Number Theory Seminar about my thesis work. 
It includes a good deal of background.
<br />
<br />
A current motivation of my research is understanding the relationship between monogenicity and other arithmetic properties of number fields. <br />
<span onClick="openClose('monoetymology')" id="abstract"><font style="color:rgb(50,200,250);">[Click here for a ridiculous footnote 
on 'monogeneity' vs. 'monogenicity' from my thesis.]</font></span>
<span id="monoetymology" class="texter">
<div style="width: 90%" align=left>
<p style="font-size: 16px;" >It appears that 'monogeneity' is more commonly used to indicate "the quality of being monogenic" in mathematics. 
However, in other fields, 'monogeneity' indicates "the quality of being monogeneous," while 'monogenicity' refers to 
"the quality of being monogenic." Some sources in mathematics refer to number fields as 'monogeneous,' rather than 'monogenic.' 
(We note that at least one paper refers to 'monogenesis,' which is often used to indicate 
"the theory that all humankind originated with a single ancestor or ancestral couple." 
For the sake of brevity, but at the expense of allegory, we will not delve deeper into this possible terminology here.) 
The author has chosen to use 'monogeneity' simply because it returns more relevant results on 
<a href = "https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/index.html">MATHSCINET</a>. 

Though, in an effort to find some solice, the author decided to investigate the etymology. 
According to <a href = "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page">Wikitionary</a>, which proved a much more satisfactory resource 
than many more well-established dictionaries, 'monogeneous' and 'monogenic' are derived from the Ancient Greek words 
μόνος (mόnos), meaning "alone," "only," "sole," or "single," and γενής (genḗs), meaning "offspring" or "kind." 
(The interested reader should note that multiple diacritics, e.g. 'ḗ,' 
on one character is a difficult feat to achieve in LaTeX. The package <i>covington</i> yields a solution that the author finds adequate; 
however, linguists may want to delve deeper down the 
<a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/159291/multiple-diacritics-on-one-character/159388">StackExchange</a> rabbit hole.)
Thus the difference lies in the suffixes '-ic' and '-ous.' The origin of '-ic' is the Latin '-icus,' 
meaning "belonging to" or "derived from." Conversely, '-ous' is derived from the Latin '-ōsus,' 
indicating "full," or "full of." The modern usages of '-ic' and '-ous' are more similar, 
but retain a connotation coming from their Latin roots. As such, 'monogenic' seems the more appropriate term to 
describe the number fields we will study. Frustratingly, it appears 'monogenicity' should be the more canonical 
way to turn our preferred adjective into a noun. 
It may also be worthwhile to note that both 'monogeneous' and 'monogenic' include mathematical definitions in their 
Wiktionary entries and neither definition is at all related to our current study.</p>

The classical Boyd&ndash;Lawton theorem concerning Mahler measures has recently been extended to multivariable limits by Brunault, Guilloux, Mehrabdollahei, and Pengo. 
In another direction, the single-variable Boyd&ndash;Lawton theorem has been generalized to various extensions of Mahler measure by Issa and Lalín. 
The goal of this paper is to present a cohesive framework for extending single-variable Boyd&ndash;Lawton theorems to multivariable Boyd&ndash;Lawton theorems. 
With this, we broaden the single-variable Boyd&ndash;Lawton theorems of Issa and Lalín to multivariable versions in the direction of 
Brunault, Guilloux, Mehrabdollahei, and Pengo, providing a generalization of both works.

Given an extension of algebras B/A, when is B generated by a single element θ∈B over A?

Local generators may not come from global ones, but they often glue to twisted monogenerators that we define. 
We show a number ring has class number one if and only if each twisted monogenerator is in fact a global generator θ. 
The moduli spaces of various twisted monogenerators are either a Proj or stack quotient of M<sub>B/A</sub> by natural symmetries. 
The various moduli spaces defined can be used to apply cohomological tools and other geometric methods for finding rational points to the 
classical problem of monogenic algebra extensions.-->

This is the sequel paper to <i>The Scheme of Monogenic Generators I</i>. It continues a study of monogenicity of number rings from a moduli-theoretic perspective. 
By the results of the first paper in this series, a choice of a generator θ for an A-algebra B is a point of the scheme M<sub>B/A</sub>. 
In this paper, we study and relate several notions of local monogenicity that emerge from this perspective. 
We first consider the conditions under which the extension B/A admits monogenerators locally in the Zariski and finer topologies, 
recovering a theorem of Pleasants as a special case. We next consider the case in which B/A is étale, 
where the local structure of étale maps allows us to construct a universal monogenicity space and relate it to an unordered configuration space. 
Finally, we consider when B/A admits local monogenerators that differ only by the action of some group (usually <b>G</b><sub>m</sub> or Aff<sup>1</sup>), 
giving rise to a notion of twisted monogenerators. In particular, we show a number ring A has class number one if and only if 
each twisted monogenerator is in fact a global monogenerator θ.

curves over ℚ with n-division fields, ℚ(E[n]), that are not monogenic, i.e., the ring of integers does
not admit a power integral basis. We parametrize some of these families explicitly. Moreover, we

order p<sup>n</sup>. To describe the minimum necessary ramification at <b><i>p</i></b>, we completely classify the valuations
of the p<sup>n</sup>-torsion points of E by the valuation of a coefficient of the p-th division polynomial. In
particular, if E does not have a canonical subgroup at <b><i>p</i></b>, we show that <b><i>p</i></b> has ramification index at
least p<sup>2n</sup>-p<sup>2n-2</sup> over p.
<br />
We apply this bound to show that sporadic points on the modular curve X<sub>1</sub>(p<sup>n</sup>) cannot correspond to 
supersingular elliptic curves without a canonical subgroup. Our methods are generalized
to X<sub>1</sub>(N) with N composite.

Consider the integral polynomials f<sub>a,b</sub>(x)=x<sup>4</sup>+ax+b and g<sub>c,d</sub>(x)=x<sup>4</sup>+cx<sup>3</sup>+d. Suppose f<sub>a,b</sub>(x) and g<sub>c,d</sub>(x) are irreducible, 
b|a, and the integers b, d, 256d-27c<sup>4</sup>, and (256b<sup>3</sup>-27a<sup>4</sup>)/gcd(256b<sup>3</sup>,27a<sup>4</sup>) are all square-free. Using the Montes algorithm, 
we show that a root of f<sub>a,b</sub>(x) or g<sub>c,d</sub>(x) defines a monogenic extension of <b>Q</b> and serves as a generator for a power integral basis 
of the ring of integers. In fact, we show monogeneity for slightly more general families. Further, we obtain lower bounds on the density of polynomials 
generating monogenic S<sub>4</sub> fields within the families f<sub>b,b</sub>(x) and g<sub>1,d</sub>(x).

We consider partial torsion fields (fields generated by a root of a division polynomial) for elliptic curves. By analysing the reduction properties of
elliptic curves, and applying the Montes Algorithm, we obtain information about
the ring of integers. In particular, for the partial 3-torsion fields for a certain
one-parameter family of non-CM elliptic curves, we describe a power basis. As
a result, we show that the one-parameter family of quartic S<sub>4</sub> fields given by
T<sup>4</sup> − 6T<sup>2</sup> − &alpha;T − 3 for &alpha; &straightepsilon; Z such that &alpha; &plusmn; 8 are squarefree, are monogenic.</span>

We find explicit formulas for the radii and locations of the circles in all the optimally dense packings of two, 
three or four equal circles on any flat torus, defined to be the quotient of the Euclidean plane by the lattice 
generated by two independent vectors. 
We prove the optimality of the arrangements using techniques from rigidity theory and topological graph theory.
