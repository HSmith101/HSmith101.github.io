<p><b>Official Course Description:</b> An introduction to the theory of groups, rings, and fields, with abstract ideas reinforced by 
concrete and important examples, such as permutation groups, polynomial rings, and finite fields.
 The power of the axiomatic systems introduced will be illustrated via several applications to concrete and classical problems.</p>

<p>
<b>Goals:</b> The overarching goal for the semester is to gain a working knowledge of and fluency with groups and rings, 
the fundamental objects of abstract algebra.
We will work to understand not only the definitions, but the parts, pieces, and maps that help us 
classify and work with these objects. <br>
One practical goal that will underpin the course is 
deepening our familiarity with and maturity in mathematics. This includes developing the ability to communicate mathematics and reason mathematically. 
We will spend our time reading, understanding, responding to, and creating mathematical arguments. 
You are probably familiar with having this sort of mathematical dialogue with an instructor, but a goal of this course is 
to open and develop this kind of dialogue with your peers. To this end, we will create a welcoming and supportive classroom
community that gives us space to make mistakes and learn. <br>

<li> Please consider how what we are doing in this course relates to the goals above and how the goals relate to the 
<a href="#outcomes"target="_blank"><font color="blue">outcomes</font></a> listed below.
I have thought extensively about how each level of this schaffolding supports the next, but I would love to hear about ways 
the course and our ability to meet our goals can be improved.

There will be psuedo-biweekly homework assignments this semester. You can find them 
in <b><a href="https://csusm.instructure.com/courses/5143/modules" target="_blank"><font color="blue">
the modules tab in Canvas</font></a>.</b> They will be created by me. 
They will feature exercises from the book and things I find interesting. 
Due dates for homework assignments are given in the 
<b><a href="AbstractAlgebraCourseScheduleSpring2023.pdf" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Course Schedule</font></a>.</b> 
In general, homework is due <strike>Friday at 11:59 pm on Canvas. (We will discuss this in class. 
After hearing everyone's input, we will decide on a good time for homework to be due.)</strike> every second Sunday
at 11:59 pm. It will be due in Gradescope. Hopefully, you've received an email enrolling you in
<b><a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/437269/assignments/2225700/submissions" target="_blank">
<font color="blue">Gradescope</font></a></b>. If you haven't, please let me know so I can resend it.
<br />
<br />
 
In general, Sean and I will grade one or two homework problems in-depth and grade the rest for completion. 
As the semester progresses, our standards for mathematical writing and logical argument will become higher.
Quizzes will feature problems that are remarkably similar to the homework or to problems we work in class, 
so spending time completing homework to perfection is
doubly advantageous. <br />
<b>Physical homework without a staple and/or with "frills" will not be accepted.</b>

<p>It is natural and expected to struggle on homework. You are encouraged to work together and come to office hours for help with homework. <b>Homework is 
a place to learn how to do things!</b> You may use whatever resources you wish on the homework as long as you cite your sources and submit your own work.</p>

<p><a href="https://digitalcommons.ursinus.edu/triumphs_abstract/3/" target="_blank"><font color="blue"><b>Primary Source Project (PSP):</b></font></a> 
In the primary source project will look at some of the primary sources (the initial research papers) where
mathematicians developed key ideas about groups. Specifically, we will be looking at quotient groups. This assignment is focussed on reading, 
understanding, and translating the historical research mathematics that has become Abstract Algebra. More details will be forthcoming as we
get closer to the project, but you will be working in groups to complete a portion of the project. We will not be doing all 60+ pages of the project.</p>

<b><u>Support</u></b>

<p>Finally, I have three+ hours a week that are specifically for helping y'all and Sean has one hour as well.
Please come to my office hours with any questions! If you think a question is dumb or you think
you "don't understand anything," then that is even more reason to come to my office hours. 
I am very used to struggling with math and I want to help everyone learn in this course.
I can assure you that I have made math mistakes that are much more embarrassing than 
any mistake you will make in this course. </p>

<p>Class attendance is not mandatory this semester, though it is highly encouraged. I know things are difficult for everyone right now and 
I know flexibility is appreciated, so I will not grade participation directly. 
However, we will have in-class assessments.</p>

</p>

<p>
We will have three quizzes and a final exam. 


<p> In-class quizzes are closed book and notes. Quizzes will likely last 30 minutes or so.

<!--<p> After hearing everyones' ideas on grading, <strike>I've decided to change the quiz format to better reflect the things you want in grading.
We will still have three quizzes, but they will be a bit longer (20-25 min.). 
You'll upload a camscanner picture of your quiz to HuskyCT once you finish, but you'll take your quiz home with you to grade yourself.
I'll give you a rough rubric/idea of how I would grade it, but you will grade and correct your quiz yourself. 
You will then turn-in your graded quiz with corrections and a reflection on how you're doing in the class one week after the original date of the quiz. 
We will talk about the expectations for the corrections and the reflection in more detail once we get closer to the date of the first quiz. </strike>

<p>The take-home final is open book and notes, but closed everything else.</b> 
Using any resource outside of your book and your notes constitutes 
academic dishonesty and will be dealt with accordingly. -->

<p><b>Make-Up Policy:</b> In general, no make-ups for quizzes will be given. 
If you are going to miss a quiz and can show proof of some officially acceptable reason, e.g.: a verifiably documented medical excuse
or a conflicting official university sanctioned activity that cannot be rescheduled, then we can make arrangements.<br />
If you are sick or something comes up, then please let me know as far before the assignment or assessment is due as you can. 
We will do our best to get through this semester safely and healthily. 
On as case-by-case basis, I can try to make arrangements in a way that is as fair and equitable as possible.

<p>
Please avoid making travel arrangements that would not allow you to take the final at the scheduled
time. A final may be rescheduled if you have more than three finals in a single calendar day
or more than four final exams in a 24-hour period. <!-- All rescheduled final exams must be approved by the
<a href="https://dos.uconn.edu/" target="_blank"><font color="blue">Dean of Students Office</font></a> and they do not easily
allow rescheduling. -->
Please note that CSUSM does <bf>NOT</bf> consider
vacations, previously purchased tickets or reservations, graduations, social events, misreading
the assigned final exam schedule, and oversleeping as viable excuses for missing a final exam.
If you think that your situation warrants permission to reschedule, please contact me as well as the DoS office as soon as possible.

This is an in-person class and has been designed to be taught in person. Not attending in person will affect your experience in this course.
However, to make it easier for you to engage in this course regardless of your situation, I will be asking for note takers and hopefully posting their notes.
Please let me know if you enjoy taking detailed notes and want to post them for everyone.
Update: Two very kind students have volunteered to take notes. 
<a href="https://csusm.instructure.com/courses/5143/modules" target="blank"><font color="blue">
The notes are now posted in the "Modules" section in Canvas. </font></a>.
There will be days where we will do graded work in class. You must let me know well before these days if you are absolutely unable to attend. 
<p>


<p>Late assignments (homework, projects, quizzes, and exams) will have points deducted based on how late the assignment is. 
I reserve the right to deduct points from late work or award no credit for late work as I see fit.
Unless otherwise noted or excepted, late work turned in after the last day of class will not be accepted.
Generally, I am happy to give extensions if you let me know well before an assignment is due. 
If you are having trouble staying on top of your assignments, please come talk to me. 
My goal is to help you learn.</p>

<p>
The last couple of years has been an incredibly tough time for everyone, myself included. 
I understand everyone is dealing with things differently and I will do my
best to be flexible and accomodating. I ask you to be open with me and to discuss issues with me when they come up. I will listen and do 
what I can to help you succeed in this course. Conversely, I am super excited to teach this course and I love this material, but this 
is my first semester at CSUSM. 
I ask that you be understanding of the mistakes I will certainly make, and I ask that you give me honest feedback about how I can
improve.

<p>
As individuals and as a class we will be respectful of everyone; language or behavior that discriminates against or excludes 
anyone will not be tolerated.
We will avoid stereotypes about who is "good" at math. Math is difficult, but also beautiful, and as a class we will work together to overcome 
difficulties and share the beauty. This is especially true with group work. You must treat your group members with respect and engage in positive 
and constructive conversations. If you are curious about what this environment looks like, I invite you to check out the

<p>Students are responsible for honest completion and representation of their work. 
Unless otherwise noted, all completed assignments are to consist solely of your own individual work and ideas
without input from any external resources or persons. 
There will be zero tolerance for infractions. 
If you believe there has been an infraction by someone in the class, please bring it to the my attention. 
I reserve the right to discipline any student for academic dishonesty, 
in accordance with the general rules and regulations of the university. 
Disciplinary action may include the lowering of grades and/or the assignment of a failing grade for an exam, assignment, or the class as a whole.
It is recommended that students consult the 
<a href="https://csusm.policystat.com/policy/7984230/latest/" target="blank"><font color="blue">CSUSM Academic Honesty Policy</font></a>.</p>
<!-- I expect you to be familiar with and abide by

help given or received on exams or quizzes, not from other people, not from tutors, not from online sites.

Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, providing or receiving assistance in a manner
not authorized by the instructor in the creation of work to be submitted for academic evaluation
(e.g. papers, projects, examinations and assessments - whether online or in class); presenting,
as one's own, the ideas, words or calculations of another for academic evaluation; doing
unauthorized academic work for which another person will receive credit or be evaluated;
using unauthorized aids in preparing work for evaluation (e.g. unauthorized formula sheets,
unauthorized calculators, unauthorized programs or formulas loaded into your calculator, etc.);
and presenting the same or substantially the same papers or projects in two or more courses without
the explicit permission of the instructors involved.

A student who knowingly assists another student in committing an act of academic misconduct
shall be equally accountable for the violation, and shall be subject to the sanctions and other

The University currently does not have a policy for children in classrooms. What follows is a reflection of my own commitments to students as parents:

You are welcome to feed your baby (breastfed and/or bottlefed) in my classroom;

If you need to pump breastmilk during class time, I would be happy to coordinate timing breaks around this; 

Unforeseen disruptions in childcare should not be a deterrent for attending class; it is perfectly acceptable to bring your child to class, as needed; 

As students and parents, you are held to the same standards as your peers (deadlines, etc.), 
but I am happy to discuss routines and practices that facilitate a healthy school-parenting balance.

As a three unit course, the award of credit in this course is based on learning activities 
outside of class meetings having been designed to require a minimum of six hours of effort each week working for most students. 
More prosaically, about two hours of work will be required for each 50 minutes we spend together in class. 
This work includes things like reading the text, working on homework problems, writing proofs, working in groups on projects, 
and studying for assessments.
